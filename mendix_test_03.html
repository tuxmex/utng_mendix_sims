Mendix uses these principles to provide a seamless experience across devices." },

            { letter: "A", text: "To execute custom Java code within the microflow", correct: true, explanation: "(Correct) This option is correct. The primary purpose of a 'Java action' in a microflow is to execute custom Java code, which allows for extending the functionality of the Mendix application beyond what is available in standard microflow activities." },
            { letter: "B", text: "To convert microflow logic into Java code", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) This option is incorrect. A 'Java action' does not convert microflow logic into Java code. Instead, it allows for the execution of custom Java code within the microflow." },
            { letter: "C", text: "To initiate a Java-based web service call", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) This option is incorrect. While a 'Java action' could be used to initiate a web service call, its primary purpose is to execute custom Java code. Initiating web service calls can be done through other microflow activities." },

        options: [
            { letter: "A", text: "To run multiple microflows in parallel", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) An exclusive split does not run multiple microflows in parallel. Instead, it evaluates a condition to decide which single path to follow." },
            { letter: "B", text: "To stop the execution of the current microflow", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) An exclusive split does not stop the execution of a microflow. It makes a decision based on a condition and continues the flow accordingly." },

            { letter: "B", text: "Choosing a unique identifier for each page", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) While unique identifiers ensure no duplication, they do not provide meaningful context about the page's content or purpose, leading to potential confusion." },
            { letter: "C", text: "Incorporating the current date and time for versioning", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) Using the current date and time for naming pages is not practical as it doesn't convey the page's purpose and can create unnecessary complexity in identifying pages." },
            { letter: "D", text: "Selecting a name based on the developer's preference", correct: false, explanation: "(Incorrect) Allowing developers to name pages based on personal preference can lead to inconsistency and confusion, especially in larger teams or projects." }
        ],
        generalExplanation: "The best practice for naming pages in Mendix is to use the name of the primary entity the page displays. This approach ensures that the page names are clear, consistent, and informative, making it easier for all team members to understand and navigate the project.
